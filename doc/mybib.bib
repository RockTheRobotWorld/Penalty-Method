abstract = {We present an algorithm for large-scale equality constrained optimization. The method is based on a characterization of inexact sequential quadratic programming (SQP) steps that can ensure global convergence. Inexact SQP methods are needed for large-scale applications for which the iteration matrix cannot be explicitly formed or factored and the arising linear systems must be solved using iterative linear algebra techniques. We address how to determine when a given inexact step makes sufficient progress toward a solution of the nonlinear program, as measured by an exact penalty function. The method is globalized by a line search. An analysis of the global convergence properties of the algorithm and numerical results are presented.},

@article{Banerjee2013,
abstract = {This paper presents the formulation and implementation of an Error in Constitutive Equations (ECE) method suitable for large-scale inverse identification of linear elastic material properties in the context of steady-state elastodynamics. In ECE-based methods, the inverse problem is postulated as an optimization problem in which the cost functional measures the discrepancy in the constitutive equations that connect kinematically admissible strains and dynamically admissible stresses. Furthermore, in a more recent modality of this methodology introduced by Feissel and Allix (2007), referred to as the Modified ECE (MECE), the measured data is incorporated into the formulation as a quadratic penalty term. We show that a simple and efficient continuation scheme for the penalty term, suggested by the theory of quadratic penalty methods, can significantly accelerate the convergence of the MECE algorithm. Furthermore, a (block) successive over-relaxation (SOR) technique is introduced, enabling the use of existing parallel finite element codes with minimal modification to solve the coupled system of equations that arises from the optimality conditions in MECE methods. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can successfully reconstruct the spatial distribution of elastic material parameters from partial and noisy measurements in as few as ten iterations in a 2D example and fifty in a 3D example. We show (through numerical experiments) that the proposed continuation scheme can improve the rate of convergence of MECE methods by at least an order of magnitude versus the alternative of using a fixed penalty parameter. Furthermore, the proposed block SOR strategy coupled with existing parallel solvers produces a computationally efficient MECE method that can be used for large scale materials identification problems, as demonstrated on a 3D example involving about 400,000 unknown moduli. Finally, our numerical results suggest that the proposed MECE approach can be significantly faster than the conventional approach of L(2) minimization using quasi-Newton methods.},

@article{vanLeeuwen2013Penalty1,
abstract = {Wave-equation based inversions, such as full-waveform inversion, are challenging because of their computational costs, memory requirements, and reliance on accurate initial models. To confront these issues, we propose a novel formulation of full-waveform inversion based on a penalty method. In this formulation, the objective function consists of a data-misfit term and a penalty term which measures how accurately the wavefields satisfy the wave-equation. Because we carry out the inversion over a larger search space, including both the model and synthetic wavefields, our approach suffers less from local minima. Our main contribution is the development of an efficient optimization scheme that avoids having to store and update the wavefields by explicit elimination. Compared to existing optimization strategies for full-waveform inversion, our method differers in two main aspects; i) The wavefields are solved from an augmented wave-equation, where the solution is forced to solve the wave-equation and fit the observed data, ii) no adjoint wavefields are required to update the model, which leads to significant computational savings. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by carefully selected examples and discuss possible extensions and future research.},

abstract = {Many structured data-fitting applications require the solution of an optimization problem involving a sum over a potentially large number of measurements. Incremental gradient algorithms offer inexpensive iterations by sampling a subset of the terms in the sum; these methods can make great progress initially, but often slow as they approach a solution. In contrast, full-gradient methods achieve steady convergence at the expense of evaluating the full objective and gradient on each iteration. We explore hybrid methods that exhibit the benefits of both approaches. Rate-of-convergence analysis shows that by controlling the sample size in an incremental-gradient algorithm, it is possible to maintain the steady convergence rates of full-gradient methods. We detail a practical quasi-Newton implementation based on this approach. Numerical experiments illustrate its potential benefits.},

This latter strength is particularly important due to interests in employing augmented Lagrangian algo- rithms for solving large-scale optimization problems.

abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed estimates of subsurface medium param- eters, such as soundspeed, from seismic data. A formulation in the frequency-domain leads to an optimization problem constrained by a Helmholtz equation with many right-hand- sides. Application of this technique in 3D precludes the use of factorization techniques to solve the Helmholtz equation due the large number of gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While more attractive from the perspective of memory use, the computations costs of iterative methods scale linearly with the number of right-hand- sides. Many sophisticated preconditioned iterative techniques have been de- veloped for the Helmholtz equation, however, they often include model-speci c tuning parameters and are thus not very attractive for inversion since the medium parameters change from one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that addresses both the need to eciently solve the Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost induced by the many right-hand-sides. To solve the Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic pre- conditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is well-suited for inversion because of its robustness. We extend this method to a block-iterative method that can eciently handle multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the computational cost of of the overall optimization procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from stochastic optimization that allow us to work with approximate gradient information. These approximations are obtained by evaluating only a small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics to adaptively determine the required accuracy of the PDE solves and the sample-size and illustrate the algorithms on synthetic benchmark models.},

@article{VanLeeuwen2012e,
abstract = {The Helmholtz equation arises in many applications, such as seismic and medical imaging. These application are characterized by the need to propagate many wavelengths through an inhomogeneous medium. The typical size of the problems in 3D applications precludes the use of direct factorization to solve the equation and hence iterative methods are used in practice. For higher wavenumbers, the system becomes increasingly indefinite and thus good preconditioners need to be constructed. In this note we consider an accelerated Kazcmarz method (CGMN) and present an expression for the resulting iteration matrix. This iteration matrix can be used to analyze the convergence of the CGMN method. In particular, we present a Fourier analysis for the method applied to the 1D Helmholtz equation. This analysis suggests an optimal choice of the relaxation parameter. Finally, we present some numerical experiments.},

@article{Aravkin2012c,
abstract = {Many inverse problems include nuisance parameters which, while not of direct interest, are required to recover primary parameters. Structure present in these problems allows efficient optimization strategies - a well known example is variable projection, where nonlinear least squares problems which are linear in some parameters can be very efficiently optimized. In this paper, we extend the idea of projecting out a subset over the variables to a broad class of maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) problems with nuisance parameters, such as variance or degrees of freedom. As a result, we are able to incorporate nuisance parameter estimation into large-scale constrained and unconstrained inverse problem formulations. We apply the approach to a variety of problems, including estimation of unknown variance parameters in the Gaussian model, degree of freedom (d.o.f.) parameter estimation in the context of robust inverse problems, automatic calibration, and optimal experimental design. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate improvement in recovery of primary parameters for several large- scale inverse problems. The proposed approach is compatible with a wide variety of algorithms and formulations, and its implementation requires only minor modifications to existing algorithms.},
